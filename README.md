# OverView
This project is made using React.js and Tailwind CSS. It consists of two main functionalities: a Todo List App and a Weather App.

# Todo List App
The Todo List App allows users to manage their tasks efficiently. Users can add new tasks, mark tasks as completed, and delete tasks as needed. The interface is simple and intuitive, providing a seamless experience for task management.

# Weather App
The Weather App enables users to search for weather information based on city names. Upon searching, the app displays real-time weather data such as temperature, humidity, and wind speed. The interface is designed to be user-friendly, providing users with essential weather information at a glance.

Both applications are built using React.js for the frontend logic and Tailwind CSS for styling. This combination ensures a modern and responsive user interface, making the apps accessible and visually appealing across different devices and screen sizes.



# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
